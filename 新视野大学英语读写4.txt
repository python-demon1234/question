1) Because the traditional model of urbanization has greatly depended on the abundance and easy availability of fossil fuels, which has caused a waste of resources and has made a devastating impact on the environment and public health.
2) There are two reasons. First, a smart city will make optimal use of all the interconnected information to better control its operations and thus make the best use of limited resources. Second, a smart city will ensure a better quality of life by providing a sustainable, prosperous, and inclusive living environment for its inhabitants. 
3) There are a variety of contributing factors, but mainly two. First, cities will remain attractive to people owing to the various benefits they provide, and continue to be the core engines of growth for all modern societies. Second, advanced technologies are now part of our daily life, including smartphones, cellular broadband, embedded computing, as well as IoT, cloud computing, big data, and AI. 
4) The key features of a smart city include efficient design, maximization of green spaces, minimization of traffic jams, sustainability of infrastructure and buildings, optimal safety, effective access to facilities, and quick responses to emergencies. 
5) The author gives an example of how a smart city will respond in case of a fire breakout in a building. 
6) The ultimate goal is to enable cities to get rid of their traditional problems and create living spaces where the inhabitants feel safe, comfortable, and efficient without being troubled by undesirable factors. 
7) To realize the ultimate goal of smart cities, China has been making huge investments in the development of technologies, such as 5G technology and IoT. 
8) It suggests that China has made a clear plan on how to advance its development of urbanization and smart cities. 

Critical thinking
1) I think building smart cities is significant for China in many ways. For example, it can drive economic growth and create jobs, encourage technological innovations and improve efficiency, offer sustainable urban development solutions, and create modern, safe, and convenient environments for citizens to live in. All these are essential for China to become more prosperous and stronger and ensure its people a happier life.
2) The examples I can think of are:
 - Traffic flow can be managed because sensors installed in the city can collect data about real - time traffic conditions and help city managers adjust the traffic flow in these areas. As a result, time and gasoline can be saved, and less air pollution will be caused.
 - Intelligent street lights with efficient lamps can save energy and costs because they are programmed to dim or brighten automatically.
 - The sewage system in a smart city can be free from problems such as blockages and overflows because sensors installed in the system can send alerts when the sewage water reaches certain limits.
 - Smart garbage bins, being self - powered with solar technology, have the ability to communicate in real time when they are full, preventing overflows and reducing the frequency of collections.
From these examples, we can see that by using embedded sensors, city managers can improve city services and enhance urban sustainability.
3) I think the challenges that need to be addressed may include:
 - Smart city development requires advanced infrastructure, which most of the current cities don’t have yet and will need generous funding and full government support to build.
 - Security issues can be challenging to smart cities. With IoT devices all interconnected, an operation system could be completely paralyzed in case of a cyberattack.
 - Privacy is an issue of concern. People may worry whether their personal data collected by IoT sensors will be improperly used.
 - Collaboration between technology firms and construction firms is a must and could be complicated sometimes.
 - Gaining the support of the city’s citizens and maximizing their engagement could be difficult and involve a lot of work.
4) I think the following four steps should be followed while we decide on a smart city project.
 - Collect data. Every smart city project starts with data. We need to collect new data, categorize them, and integrate them into data pools for analysis.
 - Identify pain points. Every urban community has its own pain points, from traffic congestion to limited parking availability and energy shortage. We need to identify the most pressing issues for the smart city project to tackle.
 - Work out the financing and budgeting plan. Smart city projects are expensive, and we should try to get funding from various sources, including city budgets, businesses, individuals, government grants, and crowdfunding.
 - Launch a pilot project. Smart city projects are irreversible. Being able to test how your project will work, such as how it will collect and process feedback, is a must. So, it’s wise to launch a pilot project first.
5) I think we can contribute to the development of smart cities in two ways.
 - Get ourselves mentally and technically prepared for urban smartness. For example, we should:
    - raise our awareness about smart services in the city through various sources;
    - learn to use smart urban apps and software.
 - Do what we can to help the city better implement smartness. For example, we can:
    - shift to smart devices in the home environment;
    - help collect real - time data and user opinions for city managers to optimize smart services;
    - help children and older people to get involved in smart city trends.

As smartphones are used by almost everyone almost every hour, many people today have come to take these do - it - all devices for granted. But if we are willing to pause for a while and think about this technology, we will easily come with a long list of changes it has brought to our life.
First, smartphones have greatly changed the way we connect with people. Via smartphones, we can instantly reach almost anyone through email, instant messaging and other apps. What’s more, we can do this without virtually spending any money. Sharing documents, photos, audios, and videos with our friends also becomes super easy and fast through social apps installed on our smartphones.
Second, smartphones have greatly changed the way we access information. Now we can use our cellphones to read books and news reports, consult dictionaries and other resource materials, and check weather forecasts and traffic conditions. We can also use them to ask questions and receive answers from our teachers and classmates, take classes and get tutoring wherever we like.
Third, smartphones have greatly changed the way we shop. Through mobile payment apps, we can make purchases in various types of stores any time of the day, and even during midnight hours. If we are not satisfied with a purchase, we can contact customer service directly and get refunded easily if we want.
There are countless other changes I can list if I continue. With smartphones enabling us to live in such a convenient way today, it’s not hard to imagine how helpless we would feel without them.

 Section B

1) This text is mainly about the trend of deurbanization / the trend of moving away from cities.
2) The main factor that triggers deurbanization is technological development. The specific areas of technology discussed in the text include decentralized supply systems, digital technology, and automation and robotics.
3) Paras. 8 - 10 focus on the disadvantages of living in cities. The author mentions a number of downsides of cities such as the hectic pace of life, constraints on household or rent expenditure, the formation of heat islands, and potential problems caused by the shrinking of cities (e.g. economic difficulties and declining incomes).

Critical thinking
1) 
 - Yes, I totally agree with the author. With the popularization of the Internet and other technologies, city - living will lose many of its advantages. As is said in the text, cities attract people primarily because of job opportunities. But in the future when telecommuting becomes the norm, people can live anywhere and work remotely no matter how far away their company is located. Another advantage of cities is convenience. However, this will not be a crucial feature either, as many things we do today in person, such as shopping and borrowing books from a library, can also be done through the Internet, making rural life equally convenient. Still another advantage of cities is their rich social life. But with the wide use of social media, people can now connect with each other no matter where they are. They can meet friends, chat, or even play games together from their comfortable rural homes.
 - No, I don’t agree with the author. I believe that cities will continue to take the lead in technological innovation, and hence will continue to outperform rural areas. Although some of the advantages cities have today may not be important in the future, other things will not change. For example, people will still want to enjoy the rich cultural life that cities offer. It is much better to visit a good art museum and appreciate famous pieces of art in person than online. Besides, the advantage of the rich social life in cities will never fade away. Friends can see each other more often and more easily if they live in cities, and they don’t have to worry about getting home too late after meeting friends at night. What’s more, with the continued development of technology, cities will provide many new benefits that rural life lacks.
2) 
 - I certainly prefer to work remotely from a suburban home. First of all, working from home will save me a lot of time because I do not need to commute to an office. This gives me more free time to stay with my family and pursue my hobbies. Second, working remotely allows for great flexibility in what clothes I wear and how I arrange my workspace. I can wear cozy clothes while working on my computer, which makes me more productive. In addition, with a suburban home, I can have a bigger space to set up my workspace and arrange it in whatever way I like. I would love to have a job that allows remote work after I graduate.
 - For me, working on site is better than working remotely. Working on site in an office makes it much easier for me to communicate with others, especially if I am working on something together with a team. Video conferences can never be as effective as face - to - face discussion. Although I may need to commute every day, I do not consider it a waste of time. I can read a book on the bus or subway. Being with people keeps me at pace with the life of the city I live in. 
3) In my opinion, the three biggest differences between living in a big city and living in a small town can be:
 - Cost of living. Living in a big city is usually more expensive as housing, restaurants, and recreational activities cost more. Living in a small town, on the other hand, can reduce costs for all these things.
 - Lifestyle. Living in a big city allows people to have a busier yet more colorful life. On the one hand, city dwellers have to be fast - paced, spending a lot of time commuting and getting much work done every day. On the other hand, they have more choices of recreational activities for their leisure time. In contrast, living in a small town, with fewer recreational choices and less commuting time, makes people’s life simpler and more slow - paced. 
 - Environment. Big cities are often more crowded and have busier traffic, but they also have more beautiful shopping malls, streets, and restaurants. In comparison, small towns are much less crowded and have less traffic, offering people more open space, more peace, and more closely - knit communities.
So, living in a big city and living in a small town can both have pros and cons. Where you decide to live depends on what matters to you most.
4) 
 - My hometown is a small village in Jiangxi Province. There are three things I like best about it: clean air, more spacious houses, and healthier food. There are lots of trees in my village, so the air quality is much better than that in cities. My family lives in a large house, which is more comfortable than most apartments in cities. People in my hometown can also eat healthier food. Vegetables and rice are fresher when most families grow their own. What I don’t like about my hometown is the lack of job opportunities. Since it is a rural area, there is not much industry except a few small factories. Most people are engaged in agriculture. There are not many jobs available.
 - I am from Guangzhou, the capital city of Guangdong Province. What I like about Guangzhou is its convenience of transportation, vigor of the economy, and abundance of cultural facilities. The city has good public transit, making it easy to get around. Guangzhou is also one of the most economically developed cities in China, and provides people with all types of work opportunities. In addition, there are plenty of cultural facilities such as museums and libraries that residents can easily access. What I don’t like about Guangzhou is its congestion and high living expenses. In rush hours, streets are crowded and traffic is slow. People spend a lot of time commuting to work. Living expenses are high. In particular, food and houses are expensive. As a result, life pressure can be high for many people.
5) There are several cities I like very much and consider good to live in, such as Qingdao, Xiamen, Shanghai, and Guilin. But if I have to choose one, I will opt for Xiamen with no hesitation. I visited it last summer and fell in love with it on the first day. It is beautiful, with unique island and coastal scenery. The climate is pleasant. It is also becoming a leading innovation center in China, especially in the field of artificial intelligence. Since my major is computer science, it can be a perfect place for me to find an IT job in the future.

1) 城市规划通常基于人口和经济持续增长的假设，但随着一些环境面临城市萎缩，一系列新的战略开始发挥作用。城市萎缩现象是城市衰落的一个过程，其复杂原因包括去工业化、内部移民、人口下降或自然资源枯竭。城市必须学会将可持续的城市发展视为一个持续的周期性变化过程，而不是假装社会经济发展是从现状到更好未来的线性和可预测的进展，这是欧盟为萎缩城市寻求具体解决方案的项目得出的结论。对这一现象的研究导致了各种战略和方法，从投机性建议、自下而上的倡议到创新的城市政策。重点似乎分为两个不同的方向：通过合理化裁员/智能缩减等方法拥抱去城市化，或者在新的场所下重塑城市，通常是通过艺术和文化视角，利用旅游业主导的再生政策。

Task 2
1) Urban - rural integration is a new stage in China’s development toward modernization and urbanization. It aims to eliminate the urban - rural dual economic structure through integrated planning for urban and rural development, and through institutional reform and policy adjustment, so that the urban and rural areas will achieve policy equality and complement each other in the mode of industrial development, enabling rural residents to enjoy the same civilization and welfare as urban residents. Only by greatly promoting urban - rural integration can the whole urban and rural economy of our country develop comprehensively and sustainably.

2) Because she has a loving husband to share the happy and difficult times in life.
3) The text implies that in reality the life of actors and actresses in the media may not be as perfect and happy as it seems.
4) Because they often divert people from the things that lead to real inner beauty.
5) The only way to develop the soul is through the feelings we experience in ordinary life events.
6) They may lack interesting thoughts or inner beauty despite looking beautiful.
7) The author mentions various experiences and events in human life in order to explain the idea that all life events are the soul’s workout / to explain the idea that all life events contribute to the growth of the soul.
8) We should seek out and build the kinds of experiences that reveal and purify our inner beauty.

Critical thinking
1) 
 - Yes, I totally agree with this opinion. All our life experiences, either good or bad, are necessary parts of the process in which we grow to be more emotionally intelligent, more confident, mature, knowledgeable and experienced, and more prepared to embrace challenges in life. Needless to say, joy, love, friendship, success, and other positive things are essential to a happy life. For instance, love from parents gives us comfort, security, and support, and it teaches us how to love others. The same is true of unhappy experiences. Take failure as an example. If we don’t succeed in solving a problem using one method, we can learn from our error and acquire better skills and knowledge so we are more likely to succeed in the future.
2) 
 - Yes. There are many people in my life from whom I have learned what true beauty means. One of them is a teacher I had in high school. She not only taught well, but also cared for the well - being of her students in every respect. I remember once a student in my class got sick and had no family members nearby. The teacher took the student home and took care of him for several days. From that teacher, I learned that true beauty is kindness, love, and genuine care for the people around you.
 - Yes. I have had several experiences that have deepened my understanding of true beauty. One example is a recent experience I had in the school library. Several weeks ago, I went there in urgent search of a book just as the library was about to close for the day. When I got there, I realized that I had forgotten to bring my student ID. After learning about my situation, the librarian said he would find the book for me while I went to the dorm to get my ID. In this way, I could pick the book up directly after I fetched my ID before the library closed. Thanks to his thoughtfulness, I got the book with no delay. What he did seems small, but it is these many small things done by ordinary people that make our society beautiful.
3) 
 - I think there are two obvious differences between inner beauty and physical beauty. First, inner beauty captures the heart, whereas physical beauty only attracts the eye. Second, inner beauty is long - lasting, but physical beauty exists only for a limited period of time. When people get older, their physical looks may change, but their inner beauty stays.
 - I think inner beauty is more important because it determines whether a person is truly happy and respectable. People with good personality traits such as kindness, friendliness, honesty, and a sense of responsibility make positive contributions to the world, which in turn makes them happy. If a person only cares about physical looks without developing inner beauty, they will never be satisfied with life since very few can have a perfect face and a flawless body.
4) 
 - In my opinion, the most important traits that make a person beautiful are honesty, kindness, and bravery. Those who are honest are trustworthy, and you feel comfortable sharing your true thoughts with them. Those who are kind are caring and understanding, and have a loving heart. They bring happiness to the people around them. Those who are brave have the courage to try new things, explore new approaches to solving problems, and overcome difficulties in daily life with determination. These traits are virtues that constitute true beauty in a human being.
5) 
 - I would like to suggest two things. One is to develop a good character through doing small things in daily life, for instance, smiling to others, respecting teachers, and caring for friends. Doing such small things brings happiness to others and allows our inner beauty to shine through. The other thing is to learn from role models through various channels, such as literature and news stories. For instance, there are a lot of inspiring stories about ordinary people who have made a positive impact on other people’s lives. If we pay attention to such stories, we will be inspired to engage in things that make our life and our society more beautiful. By making efforts in these aspects, college students can enhance their understanding of true beauty and hence develop good personality qualities that contribute to their inner beauty.

Some people today pay too much attention to their appearance. They spend an excessive amount of time and money trying to attain perfect physical beauty. However, can physical beauty truly bring happiness? My answer is a clear “No”, because outer beauty doesn’t necessarily make a person truly attractive and truly satisfied.
First, physical beauty doesn’t make one truly attractive. Being attractive is not just about how you look; it is about how you project yourself to others from the inside out. People may be drawn to your looks in the beginning, but it’s your inner qualities that determine whether they will stay in your life. Take a romantic relationship, for example. We don’t choose someone to be our life partner solely because of how pretty or how handsome they are. Instead, we choose someone based on their inner beauty – their kindness, wisdom, generosity, and other positive qualities.
Second, physical beauty alone doesn’t make one truly satisfied with life. For one thing, good looks don’t last forever as we all change over time and outer beauty will fade as we age. For another, beauty is subjective. No matter how hard you try to attain a pretty face, it is impossible for everyone to think you are beautiful because people perceive appearance differently. In fact, research has shown that one’s satisfaction with life has little to do with appearance. Even the world’s most beautiful models may suffer from low self - esteem despite their beautiful looks. What really makes people satisfied with life are the fruits of their personality and character such as diligence, sincerity, confidence, and intelligence.
To conclude, physical beauty can’t bring you true happiness because it doesn’t automatically make you appealing and contented. Happiness does not come from your stylish hair, delicate makeup, or soothing cream. Instead, it comes from what shines through your heart, your character, and your personality.

Critical thinking
1) 
 - I major in architectural design, so I read a lot about the design of classical Chinese architecture. This has gradually changed my perception of beauty. Before college, I had a narrow view of beauty that was based on simple standards such as color and shape. However, as I learn more and more about the philosophy and principles behind ancient Chinese architecture, I have started to understand that true beauty lies in the harmony and integration of human needs with natural beauty, as shown in the layout of traditional Chinese gardens.
 - I visited an art museum for the first time when I was in middle school, and that experience has had a significant influence on how I explore and appreciate beauty. I was deeply impressed with a painting of a fruit basket. Looking at that painting, I suddenly realized that ordinary things we see every day could be remarkably beautiful. I used to associate beauty with majestic scenes that we only encounter on rare occasions. After that museum visit, I became more aware of the beauty in our daily life.
2) 
 - I explore the beauty of nature every day. When I walk on campus, I enjoy listening to birds singing in the trees, seeing flowers grow and blossom, looking at the starry sky on a clear night, breathing the fresh air after rain... In fact, we do not need to make an intentional effort to seek the beauty of nature because it is around us all the time. All we need to do is to observe and notice what is already there. One thing I plan to do more often in the future is to travel around our country to enjoy the different landscapes in various regions – mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, deserts, and many more. It will be really cool to see and sense these natural wonders with my own eyes.
 - I enjoy watching nature documentaries in my spare time. They showcase the beauty of nature’s creations, such as wild animals that have remarkable hunting skills, birds whose feathers have spectacular colors, salmon that migrate thousands of miles from the sea to freshwater rivers to spawn (产卵), rain forests with skyscraping trees... In the future, I plan to do more outdoor activities to really experience nature rather than just watch it on screen. This will benefit me not only physically but also emotionally and intellectually.

 - I feel most grateful for three things, which are love from my family, friendship with my peers, and a college major I am interested in. With love from my family, I know I will always be supported and encouraged to pursue my dreams. This gives me confidence and courage to overcome challenges. Friendship with my peers provides me with a sense of belonging and companionship. I can have company from people who have similar thoughts and experiences, and who really understand my aspirations and worries, joy and sadness. Additionally, I am also studying a major that I like very much, which motivates me to study hard and to achieve success after graduation. In short, these three things make my life happy and beautiful by giving me confidence, companionship, and enthusiasm.
4) 
 - Yes. There have been many occasions in my life when I made a conscious choice to focus on the bright side of things and benefited greatly from such a choice. Here is an example. A few months ago, I read a book on plastic pollution, which was about the serious environmental problems caused by plastic products. I was shocked and very worried after reading the book, feeling that human beings are causing a huge disaster that will eventually destroy the ecosystem. But then I realized that people all over the world have been aware of the issue, and scientists have been working hard to find potential solutions. This was confirmed when I watched an online video that introduced the latest scientific research on alternative products that can replace plastics. I started to look for more information on what efforts countries around the world were making to address the issue. The more I learned, the more optimistic I felt. I even joined student volunteer groups to pick up litter along the riverside near my university.
5) 
 - I think there are three ways for us college students to explore and contribute to the beauty of our society. First, we can try to be more aware of the beautiful deeds around us. If we pay attention, we can easily find them and see how they bring happiness to people. Second, we can advocate events, activities, and behavior that help make our society more beautiful. Simple ways to do this include discussing them with friends and classmates and sharing why they are beneficial for society. Third, we can get involved in activities that benefit society. For instance, we can participate in voluntary services at weekends or during holidays. To sum up, college students can explore beauty and contribute to building a beautiful society by being more conscious of and advocating beautiful deeds, and by participating in various activities.

2)2) Chinese characters are visually beautiful and each character conveys a unique meaning, different from an alphabet that only represents sounds. The earliest Chinese characters were what we call pictographs, many of which continue to be used today after being simplified and stylized, such as 火 (fire), 山 (mountain), and 日 (sun). Take 日 as an example. While it may not be immediately clear how this character resembles the sun, we can see how it has evolved over time into its present form by looking at the more ancient form, which was a circle with a dot in the center. That evolved to an oval with a horizontal line through the center and ultimately developed into the character we recognize today.

Reading comprehension - Understanding the text
1) The first two paragraphs introduce the topic of the text to the reader by briefly describing a particular makerspace event.
2) Because in a makerspace, people can meet to experiment with new ideas. College students can also put their learning into practice and showcase their skills.
3) The maker movement began to emerge in China around 2010. It has developed quickly in China since then because of the enthusiasm of entrepreneurs and hobbyists, and the support of the Chinese government.
4) Seed Studio helps makers source, design, produce, and commercialize their ideas, and it helps people make quick prototypes and manufacture small orders of their products.
5) The Chinese maker movement is not only a drive to turn ideas into commercial products, but more importantly, it is also a way to foster innovation and create real - world communities where members can do what they love, seek consultation, take risks, and even play.
6) Because they believe that the maker movement has a lot of potential, and they expect to see important inventions or big innovations made by the makers.
7) The Chinese government’s support has enabled the makers to get a budget allocation, work on their own projects, and host fairs and events. All these are important to make the DIY culture further advance in China.
8) In China, makerspaces represent a business model that prioritizes purpose over profits. This model is helpful in building a reliable environment for people to share knowledge and create new ideas together.

Critical thinking
1) 
 - In my understanding, makerspaces are designed to foster innovation through hands - on experimentation. In a makerspace, participants can see themselves as inventors, builders, and creators. They have the opportunity to test out their own ideas to improve existing ones. Through the process of experimenting, they can develop a real understanding of abstract concepts learned from books, lectures, or other sources. Besides, in a makerspace, participants can adjust their goals and methods through trials, enabling them to become more confident in themselves. Furthermore, a makerspace can help participants develop a wide range of skills, such as critical thinking and problem - solving skills, flexibility, collaboration, adaptability, social skills, leadership, etc., which are all important for their success in the future.
2) 
 - Yes, I consider myself quite innovative. I always want to do things in new ways and like to test out whatever new ideas I have. For instance, I love knitting and have tried knitting different patterns of designs on the sweaters I made. I don’t think someone is more innovative than others. To me, everyone can be innovative as long as they pay close attention to things in their daily life and try to solve problems in their own ways.
 - No, I don’t consider myself innovative. I usually prefer the same old ways for things I do. I believe some people are more innovative than others because different people have different personalities. Some people like trying out new ideas, but others, like me, just enjoy the way things are. To me, no matter whether you are innovative or not, as long as you feel comfortable about yourself, you should not feel inferior but happily accept who you are.
3) 
 - To encourage students to be innovative and experiment with new ideas, a university can provide various platforms and opportunities. For instance, makerspace - like venues can be set up on campus and be open to students. These places can be equipped with tools and materials which students can utilize to test out their new ideas, solve problems, discover new ways of doing things, and finish projects. When teaching a course, teachers can adopt approaches that aim to support students in learning by making and doing, rather than by just listening. What’s more, the university can design different contests to encourage creativity in students by having them develop innovative ideas or projects and compete with each other.
4) 
 - Innovation, as a business strategy of a company, is important because it benefits both the company itself and our society as a whole. First, it benefits the company itself. The world is changing at a fast pace, and the ability to innovate and adopt new innovations is indispensable if a company wants to remain productive and competitive in its industry. There is no doubt that innovation can bring a company lower costs, increased productivity, a positive cultural impact, and above all, a competitive edge. Second, innovation can have a significant impact on many parts of our society. It is one of the most important sources of economic growth, job opportunities, improved living standards, and environmental sustainability.
5) 
 - To me, the much - needed inventions today would be:
 - Self - focusing eyeglasses. Just as we have self - driving cars, I think it will be great if we have self - focusing eyeglasses. Many people, including students, have eyesight problems. Though traditional eyeglasses can help, they can’t adjust their focus according to the distance between the user and the object. If there were eyeglasses that could use a built - in sensor to automatically measure the distance between the glasses and the visual target and adjust the shape of their lenses (e.g. a type of liquid lenses), they would then allow us to see clearly from any distance and save us a lot of daily inconveniences.
 - Really fast 3D printers. 3D printing makes it possible to produce complex models at a low cost. However, one big drawback is that the printing process is slow and takes too much time. For example, printing larger models can take up to several days even if the 3D printer works day and night. If we could invent really fast 3D printers, we would enjoy the technology more and use it for a wider range of practical purposes.
 - Super effective antibiotics. Today, drug - resistant infections are a serious threat to human health. Though many kinds of antibiotics have been developed to treat them, over time, certain bacteria have adapted and become resistant to the effects of these drugs. As a result, hundreds of thousands of lives are lost every year because of infections that cannot be treated with existing drugs. Therefore, inventing new super effective antibiotics, the type that is able to kill any kind of infectious virus, is highly desirable.

Organic food is grown without the use of synthetic chemicals, such as pesticides and fertilizers, and it does not contain genetically - modified organisms. Organic food includes not only fresh produce, meats, and dairy products, but also processed food like crackers and drinks. Though there is no sufficient scientific evidence, many people believe that organic food is safer and healthier than conventional food and better for the environment as well.
Organic food is believed to be safer than conventional food because it has natural ingredients. Most countries in the world require that for products to be labeled as organic, they must consist of at least 95 percent natural ingredients, which means at least 95 percent of their ingredients must come from plants and animals grown without using chemicals or artificial nutrients. As a consumer, if you prefer buying organic food, you should pay attention to the labeling on food packaging. If it says “100 percent organic”, it means the product has been manufactured without the use of any artificial additives. If it says “organic”, it means the product consists of a minimum of 95 percent natural ingredients.
Organic food is also believed to be healthier than conventional food because it is considered more nutritious. According to a study, organic food contains a higher level of calcium, iron, zinc, vitamins, and antioxidants when compared with conventional food. Besides, many people say that organic food tastes better than conventional food.
Organic food is believed to be better for the environment as well, because organic production uses less energy, consumes less water, produces lower greenhouse gas emissions, and helps reduce soil pollution. Moreover, farming without pesticides is also better for animals and people who live close to farms.
Today, organic food is becoming increasingly popular globally. Although the price of organic food is often higher than conventional food owing to its higher production costs and lower yields, many people believe that its safety, health benefits, and environmental advantages fully compensate for its disadvantages.

Critical thinking
1) 
 - If I were Kevin Johnston, I would do two things. First of all, I would familiarize myself with the UAE business culture before my trip. In this way, I would not feel surprised or confused by their “unusual” hospitality after I get there. Second, I would ask the UAE partners when would be a convenient time to meet and close the deal. Of course, I would not do this immediately after I arrive. I would follow their arrangements for tours and meals, but at some point during my stay, I would bring up the topic and do my job.
2) 
 - In addition to the factors discussed in the text, there are many other cultural elements that can affect the success of international business dealings. I can give two examples. One is the concept of time. People in different cultures or countries may vary in how they perceive punctuality and planning. In some countries like Italy and Spain, adherence to punctuality tends to be more flexible, whereas in other countries like the U.S. and Britain, timekeeping is stricter. The other factor that may influence international business interactions is body language such as gestures, facial expressions, eye contact, and head movements. For instance, the same gesture or facial expression may convey different meanings, attitudes, or emotions in different cultures. It is important that we do not assume that a certain type of body language in other cultures has the same meaning as in our own culture. Otherwise, misunderstanding may occur, which can lead to failures of business deals.
3) 
 - In my view, there are two things that are important for a foreign business to succeed in China. First of all, it needs to make its products or services fit the Chinese market. Take a foreign restaurant as an example. The taste or flavor of the food the restaurant serves in its home country may be different from what Chinese people like. In order to attract Chinese customers, the restaurant needs to research and learn about Chinese food culture and modify its menu if necessary. Second, the foreign company should have a management team that knows the Chinese language and culture well. In this way, it can get and keep good local employees, and it can establish a good partnership with local companies, both of which are essential for its business to grow and prosper in China.
4) 
 - I think it will be important to do two things. One is to be keenly aware of the potential differences between me and my international colleagues, for example, differences in our manner of speaking, body language, thinking patterns, work approaches, among many others. In this way, I will be open - minded and patient when explaining my ideas and listening to their ideas at work. The other is to be sincere and honest with my thoughts and feelings, and encourage my colleagues to do the same. If everyone in my team or the whole company can do this, we will be able to understand and respect each other despite our different cultural backgrounds. By doing these, I believe I will enjoy working with people from diverse cultures and achieve effective communication.
5) 
 - If I were to set up a business in a foreign country, I would make myself culturally competent by three means. First, I would live with a local family so that I could learn how to interact with local people properly in daily life. This would enable me to experience and learn their culture in authentic settings. Second, I would take some private lessons to study their business manners. And finally, I would find information on the culture, especially business etiquette, of the country where I plan to do business.

Understanding the text
1) People usually organize or participate in conferences, campaigns, or a variety of other activities to celebrate World Environment Day, trying to encourage everyone to increase their environmental awareness and take action to help protect the environment.
2) Biodiversity is significant in two ways according to Para. 2: It makes the environment amazingly beautiful; it sustains the ecological system that humanity is dependent upon.
3) There are two factors: excessive exploitation of natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions from industry and agriculture. The threat specifically includes a decline in the quality of life for humans, a decrease in natural assets like clean air, clear water, and fertile land, potential extinction of wild species, as well as collapse of environmental necessities like land, oceans, and the atmosphere.
4) Every country should conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions, invest in new technologies and green innovation, and adopt stricter laws and regulations.
5) Because all life organisms on earth are interconnected, the extinction of any single species can impact the survival of other species, including those that we human beings depend on.
6) Because recycling seeks to minimize waste disposal costs, reduce environmental and climate impacts, and realize zero waste. So, to conserve natural resources and achieve sustainability, recycling is a must.
7) We should consider to what extent the development will harm the habitats of wild animals and how it will consume natural resources.
8) In the author’s opinion, the goals can be achieved through existing technologies and timely adjustments in government policies, business practices, and individual behavior.
Critical thinking
1) I think there are three lessons we should learn. First, we should recognize that natural resources on earth are limited. The more we use them, the less they become. So we should try to minimize our use of them. Second, we should research the impact of consuming a certain natural resource on some wild species: whether it will cause any species to lose their habitats or become extinct. Based on our research conclusions, we can then decide on the best course of action. Third, we should make efforts to replenish the natural resources we are using. Planting more trees, clearing up rivers, and recycling more waste are all effective ways to achieve this.
2) To me, protecting biodiversity on earth is extremely important for several reasons. First, biodiversity makes the earth full of vigor and vitality, and lays the foundation for human survival and development. Second, biodiversity is essential to the healthy functioning of ecosystems. The loss of any wild species can add to the likelihood of a serious problem. Given the alarming speed at which wild species are becoming extinct, protecting biodiversity is no longer a choice, but a necessity. Third, biodiversity is a major factor in nature’s resilience. A wide variety of species can cope with natural threats better than a limited number of them in large populations. Fourth, biodiversity helps human beings stay healthy. Scientists can discover the secrets of wild plants, animals, and even microbes and use them to develop innovative medical treatments for human diseases. Fifth, biodiversity is an essential part of the solution to climate change. Conserving forests can reduce the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere; trees and plants can store carbon in their tissue; an area full of trees and grass can provide a great deal of protection against soil erosion.
3) In my opinion, to balance economic development and environmental protection and ensure sustainable development, there are several things we need to do. First, we should have foresight and make sound decisions. Environmental protection is a long - term campaign. Though the harmful impact of consuming certain natural resources may not be felt in the short term, it can build up and become enormous and long - lasting. So, it is important that we always keep in mind the imperative of environmental protection while developing the economy. Second, we should make and implement stricter laws and regulations to ensure that economic gains are not achieved at the high cost of environmental health. Factories that cause heavy pollution should be closed down and punished severely, and the conservation of some most precious natural resources should be prioritized. Third, we can adjust our industrial structures, trying to seek economic growth through other pathways which have only an indirect or limited effect on natural resources. We can also adjust our energy mix, trying to adopt more renewable energy sources in the grid.
4) There are two environmental issues I care about the most. One is climate change, and the other is garbage disposal. Because of global warming and climate change, extreme weather conditions now occur more frequently than before. The summer temperature gets above 35°C more often, and sometimes can even remain above 40°C for several consecutive days, leading to a huge consumption of electricity and water. The winter months can also be rather warm, and many places have less and less snow. With the world temperature getting higher, I’m concerned that more serious consequences may occur. Garbage disposal is also very worrying to me. Everywhere in the world, garbage of various types is produced every day: kitchen leftovers, plastic trash, construction debris, used batteries, unwanted clothes, and expired cosmetics and drugs. Finding suitable storage solutions for these various types of waste and disposing of them properly has become a great challenge.
5) I would like to mention two activities I participated in recently. One was in April, when our class organized a volunteer tree - planting activity. We went to a park close to our campus. The park was being built, and so a lot of work needed to be done. Our work arranged by the park managers was to help plant trees. After a whole day of hard labor, we planted more than 100 trees. Seeing the rows and rows of trees we had planted, we felt very proud and came back to campus happily with a great sense of achievement. The other was in last month, when I joined a volunteer group to pick up litter around our neighborhood. We removed multiple garbage bags of waste in about two hours of clean - up work. Though it was kind of tiring, being able to make our neighborhood cleaner and more beautiful made me happy.

A national park is a natural space set aside by a country’s government for the purposes of conservation, recreation, and protection. Most people believe that
necessary because they can help protect the variety of species on earth and offer people a place where they can relax and explore nature. However, there are also different opinions about the establishment of national parks. Although such opinions may sound reasonable to some people, their validity needs to be closely examined against the evidence.
Some people are against national parks because they argue that native plants and animals should be left entirely on their own, rather than being interfered with by human action. But, in my opinion, these people may have overlooked the fact that some wild plants and animals have become so rare that they need urgent protection. The establishment of national parks aims to provide a safe home for native plants and animals. Take Wolong National Nature Reserve in Sichuan Province, for example. It provides a natural habitat for giant pandas and other precious species in the area, which has guaranteed the protection of these species for decades.
Some people don’t favor the establishment of national parks because they worry that this will attract more and more visitors to these places, which they claim will gradually damage the natural environment after all, most national parks are open to the public and provide opportunities for recreation such as camping, walking, skiing, mountain biking, and mountaineering. It is true that excessive amounts of human activity will do harm to anything. But it doesn’t mean that there is nothing we can do to minimize the negative effects brought by human activities. Managers of national parks could limit the number of visitors to the parks. They can also make many other rules to regulate people’s behavior in the parks.
To sum up, I think national parks are absolutely necessary. If we make good use of them, we can not only protect the native plants and animals in the areas, but also provide people with natural open spaces for healthy exercise and recreation, and for exploring nature.

Critical thinking
1)
Yes, I agree. There are two reasons I’d like to share. One is urbanization. Due to urbanization, traditional village houses have been replaced by modern high - rise buildings. When people live or work in high - rise buildings, they have much less exposure to green spaces. The other is modern technology. People now have cars, mobile phones, and computers. As they enjoy these high - tech products, they also find themselves spending too much time indoors instead of outdoors. For example, they may spend hours surfing the Internet at home. Even if they go outside, they may choose to drive a car rather than walk. Therefore, it can be said that modernization has isolated people from nature.
No, I don’t quite agree. People feel isolated from nature simply because they live in cities which are filled with skyscrapers and vehicles. However, those living in the countryside are still so close to nature. They can enjoy both nature and the convenience brought by modern technology at the same time.
2)
No, I don’t think I can. I would feel very frustrated if I had to stay in the wilderness for a week without using any modern conveniences. I would find it hard to accept that I have no mobile phone or the Internet to connect with my friends. Also, I can’t imagine having no electric lights at night to help me see things and no air - conditioner to warm or cool the place I live in. This kind of life would be very boring and uncomfortable to me.
Yes, I think I can. It could be extremely interesting to live in a primitive style in the modern time. Though I would temporarily lose the convenience brought by modern technology, I would also enjoy very much the state of being not disturbed by any emails, phone calls, city noises, etc. In addition, it’s only a week anyway, rather than a year or a lifetime.
3) I think one important reason why this happens should be that people today live at a very fast pace and are always in a rush. They are eager to get away from nature, leaving their pressure and frustrations at work and in life behind. Through being in nature and enjoying the beautiful mountains, rivers, lakes, and forests, they can relax completely and gain a strong sense of peace and freedom.
4) Nature is very important to me because I love being outdoors, breathing the fresh air, and observing all kinds of lovely plants and animals. It brings me so much joy every time I’m in close contact with nature. I do have a favorite natural spot, which is a beautiful mountain stream in my hometown. The stream is not wide in most places, with stones of all shapes lying here and there in the water, and with plants of all sizes and types growing on both sides. The stream has clear water all year round. You can have a lot of fun simply listening to the sound of the running water, which makes you feel so calm and peaceful. Of course, if you have friends with you, you can together play in the water, or even catch fish in it. I love the stream so much that I go to visit it whenever I can.
5) To bring more nature back to cities, I think we can try the following methods:
Create tiny forests in cities. Tiny forests refer to small spots that are densely planted with trees and plants where people can easily go to experience nature.
Install green roofs or vertical gardens on or along high - rise apartment buildings, office buildings, and hotels. This enables people to enjoy the rich greenery of grass and plants when they are out of their rooms.
Build networks of trails and pathways that interconnect parks and green spaces. These park connectors allow people to walk, cycle, and jog between various green spaces without leaving green areas.
Build wildlife bridges and passages of various forms. This enables animals to move and thrive in the midst of built - up environments and allows city dwellers to see wildlife more often.

1) The author first met Henry at an adult education seminar he once gave at New York University.
2) He considered Henry an unusual person because Henry didn't fit the regular image of an animal rights activist.
3) One of Henry's earliest achievements was the permanent closure of a laboratory which did experiments with poisonous vapor on rabbits.
4) Many cosmetics companies put large amounts of money into research to find alternatives to animal experiments, and they eventually stopped testing their products on animals.
5) Henry became skilled at masterminding campaigns.
6) Henry succeeded because he was dedicated and practical, he acted, and he appealed to the public.
7) He didn't show any sign of depression because he had done what he wanted to do and enjoyed it very much.
8) One essential mark of living well is being satisfied with one's achievements when looking back at life and being able to accept death calmly.
Critical thinking
1) I think Henry Spira had a meaningful life because of three reasons. First, he was dedicated to what he was passionate about. He had great enthusiasm for the animal rights movement, and he was determined to have this as his lifelong pursuit. Second, he didn't just work toward his goal blindly, but rather planned his campaigns with skill and strategy. Third, his work helped make the world better by reducing the suffering of animals. It was due to his campaigns that many companies put serious efforts into finding alternative methods to test their products rather than use lab animals.
2) I consider three things to be most important when choosing a career. The first one is interest. If I'm interested in a job, I will have the motivation to keep learning new things and improving in my skills to become good at it. The second one is feasibility. This may involve many considerations, for instance, whether I have the necessary talent and competence, whether I can make enough money to support myself and my family, or whether it is practical in terms of location or other factors. The third one is the influence on society. I want my career to be beneficial to society and make people's lives better. For example, if I decide to be a teacher, I would like to be a good teacher who cares for students in every way, not only teaching them knowledge, but also guiding their soul.
3) In my opinion, there are four essential characteristics of a meaningful life.
Pursuing one's interests or passion freely. This makes us feel that we have a purpose in life and that there is something in the world worth committing to.
Facing challenges in life bravely. Challenges and difficulties are inevitable. We should maintain a positive attitude and move on. In this way, we can learn from them and grow to become better at combating what life presents us.
Building a successful career. The process of building a career and achieving success allows us to exercise our intelligence and skills, and get involved in social development. It also provides us with the opportunities to meet people who share similar professional interests.
Having a happy family. A happy family can provide love and support for whatever we do in life. When we feel happy, we have someone to share with; when we feel stressed, we have someone to talk to and thus get refreshed.
4) When we encounter failures and obstacles, it is important for us to do the following:
Remain calm and reflect. We should stay calm and analyze the situation to find out what causes failures or what the obstacles are. Then we will be able to understand the challenges and then see where we need to improve to succeed.
Maintain a positive attitude. We should use failures and obstacles to our advantage because they are the best lessons in our life. If we handle them appropriately, they can push us a step closer toward our goal. So we just need to keep going and believe in ourselves.
Ask for advice from others. We can seek advice from various resources such as family, friends, teachers, and colleagues. They may have experiences in handling similar situations, thus giving us valuable suggestions or a new perspective on things.
Failures and obstacles are inevitable in our life. It is impossible for us to live without them. But if we face them calmly, stay positive, and ask for advice when needed, we will be able to overcome setbacks and succeed.
5) 
Yes, I once watched a documentary on TV about a woman who gave up a good job in a big city and went to teach in a mountainous region of China. Though she may not earn much money, she enjoys what she is doing. I think she does something very meaningful because she is using her knowledge and experience to change many children's lives.
Yes, I recently read a story on the Internet about a man who left his successful career in a famous international tech company and established a wildlife rescue center with his own savings. The rescue center is located in a remote area, and he is so busy that he can only visit his family several times a year. His efforts helped save hundreds of wild animals every year. He gave up comfort and money to save vulnerable lives.

From elementary school through college, there have been many classes that have left a lasting impression on me. Out of all those, the best one was a vivid, interactive, and engaging biology class I attended in high school.
It was a class I had in my second year of high school. The teacher was Ms. Cindy Moore, who always had a smile on her face. The class was about the human eye. After the lesson began, Ms. Moore asked us to gather around one large table. There she unrolled some large sheets of paper and started to draw a cross - section of an eye with a marker.
“What is this?” she asked as she drew. We all started to call out the parts we recognized “lens”, “pupil”, she wrote down the words on the paper to label the corresponding parts of the eye.
While she was doing that, we were fully engaged. We all leaned forward like eager children. We laughed and complimented the person who came up with a name that the rest of us didn't know. It was so much fun!
After that, she explained how the human eye works and how we are able to see. Then she asked us if we are short - or long - sighted. “Short - sighted,” many of us said.
She started to draw the eye again on a fresh piece of paper, explaining that being short - sighted means the light rays are focused on a point in front of the retina instead of on the retina. For this reason, those who are short - sighted are unable to see objects in the distance clearly.
Then we were allowed to ask many questions. Someone asked her to explain long - sightedness. Someone else wanted to know how laser refractive surgery works... She answered them by giving examples and drawing new pictures.
She made the class so interesting that we were inspired to learn more. We learned a lot without even being aware of it! This class will always stay in my memory because it combined all the elements of a good class: vividness, interaction, and participation.

Critical thinking
1) Finding what one is passionate about in life is a journey in itself. For those who don't know yet what their passion is, I suggest they do the following to find it. First and foremost, they should keep trying new things. If they don't consciously explore new areas of interest or develop new skills, they may never be able to discover what they really like. Second, they should build a good network of friends. Doing things and sharing experiences with people who have either similar or different interests can inspire new ideas and perspectives. A casual conversation with someone may spark one's interest in something that turns into a passion. You never know what will come up and when. Lastly, they should have a self - reflection and ask themselves some questions: What do I spend a lot of my free time on? What do I love talking about? What excites me?... By doing these three things, I believe they will gradually get closer to their passion and eventually find the one thing that grabs their heart.
2) A significant turning point in my life was reading a book in middle school. On my birthday, my uncle bought me a book as a gift. It was about the greatest machines invented in human history. It told the stories of those inventions, along with simple but interesting illustrations or pictures. I was instantly interested and finished the whole three - hundred pages or something within several days. That book triggered my interest in mechanical engineering. In fact, I became so intrigued that it turned into a passion! That was why I chose mechanical engineering as my college major. If I hadn't got such a birthday gift, I might have chosen a different academic path. Sometimes a small thing can influence our life significantly.
3) I think the following factors are most important for career success.
Passion. Passion motivates and inspires us. It encourages us to overcome setbacks and drives us to work toward our goals.
Diligence. No matter how good our idea is or how much passion we have, hard work is essential for turning a dream into reality. As people often say, “No pain, no gain.” Success only comes to those who make real efforts to achieve their goals.
Perseverance and patience. Success is not achieved overnight, and we are bound to encounter challenges and experience difficulties in our career. Persistence and patience make us stay confident in the face of setbacks.
Intelligence. Our mental abilities such as cognitive skills and reasoning ability are vital factors that determine whether we can learn quickly, make sound inferences, or have smart solutions to problems.
Financial resources. We need adequate financial resources to implement our plan, for example, the money to get necessary books, purchase equipment, or build a lab.
4) The goal I want to achieve in the next five years is:
Getting a graduate degree in computer science. To achieve this, first, I will study hard to prepare for the graduate entrance examination. Once accepted into a graduate program, I will then focus on developing my research skills and do a good project for my thesis.
Working in a large tech company. To realize it, I plan to do internships at some famous companies in my field of study to build up my professional skills and experience.
Setting up my own business. To achieve this, I will pay close attention to the trends of technological development, develop necessary business management skills, and learn from great entrepreneurs.
5) 
I definitely prefer to pursue my passion as a career. By combining what I really like with what I do for a living, I will have the determination and strong will to overcome any difficulties. As a result, I will be more likely to be successful in my career. Even if I fail, I won't regret it because I am doing something I love, something I am truly passionate about.
I prefer to keep my passion as a hobby pursued in my spare time rather than make it a lifelong career. I love photography and enjoy experimenting with various subjects and artistic methods. But if I had photography as a career, probably I wouldn't be able to take the kind of pictures I like. For instance, in order to make enough money to support my life, I might have to take photos that are more profitable such as wedding photos.

退学之后挣个一两百万已经成为了年轻创业者的标签。人们感到很惊讶，退学之后成为富翁的人数是如此之多。史蒂夫·乔布斯仅在里德学院上了一个学期就退学，之后成为了美国最有影响力的企业家之一；比尔·盖茨退学之后创立了自己的软件公司，并成为微软的首席执行官；马克·扎克伯格从哈佛大学退学，专心致力于自己的项目，创立了脸书公司。确实，这些亿万富翁都在高等教育阶段退学，而且赚了很多钱，但他们是例外，并非常规。需要注意的是退学并不是使他们致富的原因，勤奋、专注和热情才是他们成功的秘诀。因此，上学并获得学位是非常重要的。当然了，除非你有能够改变一个行业的绝妙想法，并且即使没有学位就拥有所需要的技能，那样的话，就大胆地退学创业吧。而事实是，很多退学的人都不如那些拥有学位的人成功。

1) 巴勃罗·毕加索1881年出生于西班牙，是历史上最受尊敬的艺术家之一。此外，他还是版画家、诗人和剧作家。他创作了20世纪的一些最伟大的画作。在他的一生中，他多次改变创作技巧，因此很难确定他的标志性风格是什么。早年间，他的画作描绘丰富多彩的蓝色调的场景，后来则转向蓝绿色调，经常描绘贫民的场景。毕加索的父亲也是一位艺术家。他对儿子倾囊相授，直至毕加索超越了他。毕加索得到了走上成功绘画生涯的所有必要的鼓励。这使他有幸进入西班牙一些最好的艺术学校学习。14岁时，他随家人搬到了巴塞罗那，并被当地的美术学校录取。在第二次世界大战期间活跃于政坛，他最终拥有了非常成功的职业生涯，并在国际上取得了成功，直至1973年因心力衰竭去世。
2) The high - speed railway is a successful example of China’s independent innovation. Despite developing the high - speed railway more than 40 years later than some developed countries, China has now become the country with the longest operating mileage of high - speed railway, the largest scale of construction, the most high - speed trains in operation, and the highest commercial operation speed in the world. With the opening of a large number of high - speed lines, China’s high - speed railway network is expanding from the “four vertical and four horizontal” to the “eight vertical and eight horizontal.” Looking back at the history of China’s railway development, it has made a tremendous leap from learning and catching up to leading the way. Among the most crucial factors is the insistence on independence and self - reliance, as well as mastering core technologies.

1) The world depended mainly on non - renewable fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for industrial development in the past.
2) There are two major problems with fossil fuels: Their availability is limited, and they cause health and environmental problems.
3) It means that the happy times of sufficient supply of cheap energy from fossil fuels will soon be over. Here honeymoon is used metaphorically.
4) With the world population growing to nine billion before 2040, human demand for energy will surge, and energy consumption will likely undergo a linear increase of 50 percent.
5) The author wants to illustrate that although renewable energy sources are promising, there are still various problems with these "new energy" technologies. The greatest challenge is to find ways to use these technologies more efficiently and at lower costs.
6) Biomass energy is a renewable energy option, but its production can cause air pollution and ozone layer depletion. Its production process is also complicated and costly.
7) According to the author, the best solution to the world’s energy problem should be a mixture of various energy technologies that won’t cause damage to the environment, rather than any single technology.
8) The purpose of the text is to convince us that our world will be faced with a serious energy crisis shortly, and we should work quickly and cooperatively to find the best solutions.

Critical thinking
1)
Yes, I agree that there can be an energy crisis in the world in the near future because:
Non - renewable fossil fuels are being used up.
Nuclear energy is not highly economical due to its inherent drawbacks.
Renewable energy sources are still too expensive, and are hard to be used on a large scale in the short term.
Human population keeps increasing.
Both developed and developing countries need more energy than before to continue their economic growth.

No, I don’t agree that there will be an energy crisis in the world in the near future because: 
There are still abundant oil and natural gas resources in the world, and new reserves are being discovered from time to time.
People are becoming increasingly conscious of energy conservation, which plays an important role in preventing an energy collapse.
Energy - efficient products and buildings are becoming more common in our life.
New energy technologies are being developed or improved all the time.

2) I think many problems would occur if there were an energy crisis. For instance:
a sharp rise in energy prices;
unstable energy stock values;
possible economic recession;
inflation and
higher unemployment rates.

3) The main factors that can cause the fluctuations in oil prices usually include:
changes in oil supply and demand;
oil speculation activities;
political uncertainty or turmoil;
natural disasters; and
monopolies held by oil - producing nations.

4) It is important for us to develop and use more and more renewable energy because:
Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power produce significantly less greenhouse gases than fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, allowing us to breathe clean air and see clear blue skies.
Some forms of renewable energy, like solar and wind power, do not cause water contamination. They are produced from photovoltaic panels or wind turbines with virtually no use of water, enabling us to enjoy better water quality.
Solar energy has the advantages of producing no noise and can be easily used by homes, contributing to a better and quieter living environment. It also reduces our electricity bills if we use a solar - powered water heater for our home.
Renewable energy sources save us from the worry about an energy shortage or crisis, because they can replenish themselves, such as sunlight, wind, water, biomass, and geothermal heat.
Renewable energy development is one of our country’s most important strategies toward combating climate change and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.

5) I think we should consider at least three factors: feasibility, cost, and environmental impact. First, we should consider the feasibility of developing a certain type of energy in a local area. For example, if there is no major water resource there, then it will be impractical to develop hydroelectric power in the area. Second, we should consider the cost of developing a certain type of energy source. If the cost of producing or transporting that fuel is too high for an area, then we’d better give up the related proposals. Third, we should evaluate the impact of an energy project on the local environment. If the impact will be severe or irreversible, then we should not approve of the project for the area. Anyway, to me, energy projects we structure and set up should aim to take advantage of the available and reliable natural resources of a local area, be it sunshine, wind, water, or natural gas, so that they can be sustainable and benefit local communities in the long term.

 Structure analysis and writing
 Structured writing - Practicing
As the world’s oil supply runs out, it becomes more urgent to develop sustainable energy sources. As one of the available new energy alternatives, nuclear power is good because it is reliable and clean. However, in my mind, it is not the best energy option due to the environment, safety, and health concerns it poses. 
First, nuclear power poses serious environment concerns. Though nuclear power plants emit no carbon dioxide, radioactive waste, such as spent reactor fuel rods, can remain active for hundreds or even thousands of years, and safe disposal of such waste is still difficult. Besides, much of the equipment in nuclear power plants can become contaminated with radiation, which can cause serious problems to the local environment. Nuclear power plants also use large quantities of water for steam production and cooling, thus affecting water quality and aquatic life.

Second, nuclear power causes serious safety concerns. Although it is often said that the nuclear power industry has a "superb safety record", a few major nuclear disasters in the past have left many people believing that nuclear power plants are not safe enough. Both technical failure and human error can occur, leading to nuclear accidents. Even if there were no nuclear accidents, some by - products of nuclear reactors could be improperly used by insurgents to make nuclear explosives. Moreover, nuclear power plants could become prime targets of terrorist attacks, and it’s not easy to develop a satisfactory plan to protect nuclear power plants from terrorism.

Third, nuclear power raises a number of health concerns. The small amounts of radioactive material released during routine operations of the plants could have detectable medical effects on nearby populations over the long term. In the event of a nuclear disaster, health concerns can become more obvious. Exposure to radioactive fallout may lead to an increased risk of genetic disorders, cancer, and other diseases, according to some studies.

So, as an energy alternative that is stable and creates no greenhouse gas emissions, nuclear power can be developed and used, but this should be done only on a limited scale. It is not the best solution to our energy problem due to the various concerns it raises. To meet our increasing demand for energy, scientists have to work hard to find ever - better solutions.

Section B
Reading skills
Practicing
1) There is a question mark in the title. By using a question mark in the title, the author tries to attract our attention and prepare us for active thinking. From the title, we can see that the text is about the possibility of a worldwide food crisis.
2) Yes, there are two different points of view in Paras. 2 - 3.
Is their fear grounded? Consultancy firms measuring the status of commodities like wheat don’t think so. (Para. 2)
However, this rosy picture provides only temporary security. The bigger picture discloses a reality not so optimistic. (Para. 3)
3) Yes, there are two rhetorical questions in the text.
Is their fear grounded? (Para. 2)
Will current prices stay high and volatile? (Para. 6)
4) Yes, there is a quote in Para. 8. It is from a pamphlet by an Australian philosopher: "the problem isn’t that we are producing too little food; rather we’re not eating the food we grow. Nearly 100 million tons of grain per year is turned into bio - fuel that goes into gas tanks. The problem is that we relatively affluent have created a system of piracy where we consume four or five times as much food as would be possible if we were to actually eat the crops we grow directly." The quote is used to illustrate that large quantities of food we grow are actually not consumed as food but used for producing bio - fuels.
5) The language of the text can be described as formal, serious, and evaluative, which is evident from the text’s long and complex sentence structures, affirmative tone of writing, descriptive adjectives, and modal verbs that express strong opinions, like need, must. 
etc. So, judging from the answers to all of the questions here, we can conclude that the text is meant to be persuasive.

Critical thinking
1) Other factors which can cause food prices to rise may include rising oil prices, climate change, natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, soil pollution, and food market speculation. These factors can all lead to increases in food prices because they can push up the costs of food production, make it more difficult to grow crops, or cause unnecessary panic among the public about food price.
2) I think the following problems would occur if food prices were too high.
Decreased quality of life. Families, especially low - income families, would have to spend a larger portion of their income on food, leaving less money for other daily necessities.
Increased health risks. If food prices were too high, people would probably choose cheaper or less healthy food, which could have long - term negative effects on their physical well - being.
Economic slowdown, especially in food - importing countries. If food prices were too high for countries that import significant amounts of food, rising import bills can potentially put a brake on their economic growth and development.
3) To me, food security means everyone has access to adequate amounts of nutritious and safe food at all times, so that they can maintain a healthy and active life. To ensure food security in our country, I think the following measures are important and should be taken.
Increase crop yields by promoting the use of modern farming technologies.
Provide financial resources for and send agricultural experts to rural areas.
Encourage development of sustainable agricultural practices.
Guarantee fair payment for farmers’ labor by making and implementing related policies.
Monitor the food market closely and strengthen regulations to prevent panic buying and guide farmers to make rational production decisions. 
Ensure that food supply chains function normally.
Develop energy technologies and reduce the use of crops to produce bio - fuels.
Encourage people to reduce food waste.

4) Yes, a person I can immediately think of is Yuan Longping, China’s top rice scientist. His high - yield hybrid rice has helped create a great wonder - easing hunger in China, and beyond. Yuan started his pioneering research on hybrid rice in 1964. After nine years of painstaking research and testing, his team successfully cultivated a hybrid - rice strain in 1973. Over the next four decades, Yuan worked on improving hybrid rice. Today in China, the annual hybrid rice planting area accounts for a major portion of the total rice planting area. Outside China, Yuan’s hybrid rice has been grown in more and more countries. Besides, Yuan and his team also successfully developed varieties of saline - alkali tolerant rice (耐盐碱水稻), which was intended to transform millions of hectares of saline - alkaline land in China.
Yuan’s lifelong dedication to reducing hunger made him a national hero and a household name in our country. People speak highly of his contributions to China’s food security, innovation in agricultural technology, and global grain development. In 2004, Yuan Longping won the World Food Prize. In 2019, he was awarded the Medal of the Republic, China’s highest state honor.

5) To save food wisely in our daily life, I recommend the following tips:
Eat at home or in the school canteen more often than in a restaurant.
Eat less snack food and junk food and choose more healthy food.
Avoid buying any food we do not really need.
Don’t cook too much food each time. Cook only the amount we will eat.
Don’t order more food than needed when dining in a restaurant.

2) People consider food as paramount, and food relies on soil as its foundation. Soil is the source of all things and the basis of agriculture. The grains people depend on for survival cannot be cultivated without soil. Without healthy soil, there is no future for humanity. December 5, 2022, marked the ninth World Soil Day, with the theme "Soil: Where food begins", aiming to increase our understanding of soil and encourage an improvement in soil health across our societies by tackling the growing challenges in soil management. A tablespoon of soil contains more microbes, insects and other organisms than the human population on earth. Soil, composed of living organisms, minerals and organic matter, cultivates plants to provide food for humans and animals. Globally, around 95% of food comes from soil. To meet the global food demand by 2050, agricultural production must increase by 60%. Through sustainable soil management practices, we can hopefully achieve a 58% increase in food production.
