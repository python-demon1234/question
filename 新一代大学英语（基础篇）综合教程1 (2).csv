At first I didn't think we would hit it off: We didn't seem to have similar hobbies or interests. But then he asked if I wanted to play a video game with him.

It was raining, and I forgot to bring an umbrella with me! I regretted that I had refused my parents offer to help me settle down because I wanted to find out what independence was like. I had no idea how to get registered and where my dorm was. Fortunately, some volunteers spotted me. They said my confusing look told them I was new here. The most unforgettable scene was that a lovely girl shared with me her umbrella and walked me to my dorm. 1-5 iExplore 2: Building your language Words and expressions l. pursue"

1749369078.jpg,"1) I am deeply impressed by Rowling's experience. Before she became one of the most successful writers in the world, she went through the darkest period of her life. She lost her beloved mom and got divorced. However, she never gave up and persevered in her attempts to be a good mother and to tell great stories. The hardship in her life motivated her to reach her full potential and she finally succeeded. Rowling's experience is very inspiring. I thought J. K. Rowling must have been a genius and she succeeded simply because of her talent for writing. After watching the video clip, I realize that she has succeeded because she has managed to overcome hardships and failures in her life. No one can achieve one's dream in an easy way."
1749369078.jpg,"2) As far as I'm concerned, hardship in life indeed motivates people to try harder and to do better. I totally agree with the conclusion in the video clip that ""In life, it is not what happens to us that matters, but rather how we choose to interpret what happens, and therefore who we become as a result."" Hardship might sound frustrating, but those blows and setbacks provide you with the strength to deal with the ups and downs in life. Successful people are those who persevere and never give up. It is clearly demonstrated in the video clip that the role hardship plays in one's life depends on one's attitude to it. The difference in attitudes is the fundamental reason why some people succeed while others fail. To those successful people, like Rowling, they won't"

I am deeply touched by the pride and confidence on her face when she was sharing her definition of success with the audience. To most people graduating from high school at such an ""old"" age is nothing to be proud of. However, success doesn't just mean excellence, perfection or glory. It is also about achieving the goal you set for yourself, no matter how big or small it is. Once you achieve your goal, you are successful. You deserve a big thumbs-up and should be proud of yourself. I am deeply impressed by the lady who wants to go to law school so as to help change laws and to improve society and the world Success is not the synonym of fame, social status or wealth. Compared with personal achievement or improvement, contribution to the welfare of human beings is a great success of an individual and of the whole society."

Success means having great determination to achieve your dream despite the difficulties and hardships on the way. Success is keeping smiling when encountering hardships and frustrations Success is having a loving family and a healthy body.
