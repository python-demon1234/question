For another, they find companies more and more demanding. That's why they may feel a lot of pressure in finding a job. Many reasons lead to this situation. To begin with, the whole society has become more competitive. More and more college graduates are hunting for jobs while the number of jobs is limited. In addition, employers prefer to choose the best among candidates ®公众号·满分学习"

Last but not least, some students do not want to do the basic work in a company; they hope to start their ca- reer at a high position as a manager and earn more money. As far as l am concerned, the whole society should do something to change this situation. First, college students should change their attitudes towards jobs. Second, universities should orga- nize lectures about how to choose a suitable job. Third, companies should provide the graduates with some intern opportunities. These efforts will un- doubtedly enable students to find sat- isfactory jobs."
