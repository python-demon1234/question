1) My campus life is the very start of my real independence. When in high school, I depended a lot on my teachers and parents. But in college, I have to make my own decisions and discipline myself.
2)Yes. I can safely say that dorm life is by far the most rewarding part of my college life outside the classroom. Living under the same roof with people from all over the country provides me with new perspectives to see the world.
No. I'm not really excited about living on campus, because my parents and old friends live far away from me. I'm not sure whether I could make new friends here or how to survive in this totally new environment. I feel a bit anxious when all my past life drops away.

1)My parents came with me on my move-in day, but once we had all of my stuff set up we said goodbye to each other. I was alone in my dorm room with a stranger of my age. At first I didn't think we would hit it off: We didn't seem to have similar hobbies or interests. But then he asked if I wanted to play a video game with him. It turned out we were both big fans of the game. So there we sat, playing that game for an hour until other roommates moved in! My move-in day was at first a mess! It was raining, and I forgot to bring an umbrella with me! I regretted that I had refused my parents offer to help me settle down because I wanted to find out what independence was like. I had no idea how to get registered and where my dorm was. Fortunately, some volunteers spotted me. They said my confusing look told them I was new here. The most
unforgettable scene was that a lovely girl shared with me her umbrella and walked me to my dorm.

Every culture has specific rituals for greeting. Some countries in Europe and Latin America share the common custom of kissing on the cheek as a form of greeting. Yet, the French seem to take this to a new level with the number of nuances involved in their kissing rituals. The rules vary for men and women. What's more, the number of kisses required to complete the greeting changes from region to region.
Unlike many other countries who don't tip at all or who only tip in
small amounts, tipping is rather mandatory at most restaurants in the
US. In fact, it is expected that patrons leave about 10-20 percent of
the bill for tips. While some criticize this practice as irrational,
there's no doubt that tipping encourages waiters and waitresses to
provide better service.

The biggest attraction of in-store shopping is you can see the various products. Thanks to the VR technology we can "see" the whole store without stepping foot outside the front door. Plus, the customers' ratings and friends comments on the products are at our fingertips, which definitely helps us to make smart choices while We can enjoy the great fun wandering in the store but don't need to worry about the traffic, waiting line or delivery.

1)I am deeply impressed by Rowling's experience. Before she became one of the most successful writers in the world, she went through the darkest period of her life. She lost her beloved mom and got divorced. However, she never gave up and persevered in her attempts to be a good mother and to tell great stories. The hardship in her life motivated her to reach her full potential and she finally succeeded.
Rowling's experience is very inspiring. I thought J. K. Rowling must have been a genius and she succeeded simply because of her talent for writing. After watching the video clip, I realize that she has succeeded because she has managed to overcome hardships and failures in her life. No one can achieve one's dream in an easy way. 2)As far as I'm concerned, hardship in life indeed motivates people to try harder and to do better. I totally agree with the conclusion in the video clip that "In life, it is not what happens to us that matters, but rather how we choose to interpret what happens, and therefore who we become as a result. Hardship might sound frustrating, but those blows and setbacks provide you with the strength to deal with the ups and downs in life. Successful people are those who
persevere and never give up.
It is clearly demonstrated in the video clip that the role hardship plays in one's life depends on one's attitude to it. The difference in attitudes is the fundamental reason why some people succeed while others fail. To those successful people, like Rowling, they won't 
give up easily when facing hardship. While to those who fail,
hardship is their common excuse to stop making efforts.

1)I am deeply impressed by the mom who went back to school and obtained her high-school diploma at 27. I am deeply touched by the pride and confidence on her face when she was sharing her
definition of success with the audience. To most people graduating from high school at such an "old" age is nothing to be proud of. However, success doesn't just mean excellence, perfection or glory. It is also about achieving the goal you set for yourself, no matter how big or small it is. Once you achieve your goal, you are successful. You deserve a big thumbs-up and should be proud of yourself.
I am deeply impressed by the lady who wants to go to law school so as to help change laws and to improve society and the world. Success is not the synonym of fame, social status or wealth.
Compared with personal achievement or improvement, contribution to the welfare of human beings is a great success of an individual and of the whole society.

2)Success is something you get after you work hard to get to it. It is not how far you get in life, but what you do to get there.
Success means having great determination to achieve your dream, despite the difficulties and hardships on the way.
Success is keeping smiling when encountering hardships and frustrations.
Success is having a loving family and a healthy body.
Success means being faithful to your original aspirations and forging ahead.

powerful, social networks closer and in almost every realm of human activities, technology is at work. Yet perhaps even more fascinating is that technology itself is constantly evolving in the same way technology changes people's lives for the better. This is another aspect of technology's beauty.

1)Yes, water crisis is a serious problem in China. The water
resources are just 27 percent of the global average and are unevenly distributed, with northern parts of the country deficient in water. The areas south of the Yangtze River, which account for about 37 percent of the country's total territory, have 81 percent of its total water resources. However, the areas north of the Yangtze, which make up about 63 percent of China, possess only 19 percent of its total water resources.
But the good news is that China is making efforts to conserve its water resources and to address its current water challenges.

1) With the development of urbanization, the issue of light pollution is becoming increasingly prominent. This is especially the case in large cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou where you can hardly experience a natural night with so many lights on.
2)It is undeniable that artificial lights bring us a lot of convenience. For example, we can have a better view at night, and many
landmarks are beautifully illuminated. However, helpful as artificial lights are, they can be troublesome if not used in a rational way. For instance, an excessive amount of artificial lights may cause sleep troubles, leading to health problems.
