However, the cow then moved through one of the nets, knocking down a police officer in the process Police eventually trapped the cow between two vehicles parked on either side of a baseball field's bench area. An officer then shot an arrow to put it to sleep. Then officers waited for the drug to take effect. After it fell asleep, they loaded the cow into a horse trailer.

My View on College Students Job- hunting Nowadays, many college students find it hard to get good jobs after graduation. For one thing, students cannot find satisfactory jobs. For another, they find companies more and more demanding. That's why they may feel a lot of pressure in finding a job. Many reasons lead to this situation. To begin with, the whole society has become more competitive. More and more college graduates are hunting for jobs while the number of jobs is limited. In addition, employers prefer to choose the best among candidates ®公众号·满分学习"
1749184567.jpg,"because they have more choices. Last but not least, some students do not want to do the basic work in a company; they hope to start their ca- reer at a high position as a manager and earn more money. As far as l am concerned, the whole society should do something to change this situation. First, college students should change their attitudes towards jobs. Second, universities should orga- nize lectures about how to choose a suitable job. Third, companies should provide the graduates with some intern opportunities. These efforts will un- doubtedly enable students to find sat- isfactory jobs. 2.Phasing out the FM radio signal 3.Let broadcasters invest more in programming. 4.Technology brings jobs to the disabled. 5.More than 300. 6.An egg a day may help young children grow to a healthy height. 7.lt divided participants into two groups. 8.To have diversified foods in their diets. 9.He had an adventure in Tokyo 10.Catch up on his sleep. 11.He went to see an active volcano. 师公众号·满分学习"

The most common use of red packets is during the Chinese New Year when elders give red packets to children or members of the younger generation. The red color of the packet symbolizes good luck and is supposed to ward off evil spirits. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, adults gave bronze coins threaded with red strings to children as a lunar New Year gift to protect them from evil. Today, money is placed inside red envelopes, which are given to represent luck and wealth. In any case, the amount of money given is always even number and amounts ending with 8 are very popular as the number 8 sounds like""发""in Chinese, which signifies prosperity. 模拟训练2 1.
